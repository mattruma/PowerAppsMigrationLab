# Lab 1

## Overview

Migrate a Canvas App and a Flow from one environment to another.

## Steps

In the `Lab 1` folder import the package `Package.zip` into your `Working` environment.

Might take several minutes for the components to all show up.

**Run** the `Migrate - Lab 1 - Canvas App` Canvas App, just to make sure the import was succesful.

**Create** a solution, name it `Migrate - Lab 1 Solution`.

**Add** the following components to the solution:

* Migrate - Lab 1 - Canvas App
* Migrate - Lab 1 - Flow 1

Turn the flow `on`.

**Export** the solution as a `Managed Solution`.

**Import** the solution into another environment, other than `Working`.

**Run** the `Migrate - Lab 1 - Canvas App` Canvas App in the new environment, just to make sure the import was succesful.

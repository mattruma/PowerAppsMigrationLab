# Power Apps Migration Lab

Lab on how to migrate Power Apps and Power Automate to a solution and then to another environment.

## Lab 1

In the `Lab 1` folder import the package `Package.zip` into your `Working` environment.

Might take several minutes for the components to all show up.

Create a solution, name it `Migrate - Lab 1 Solution`.

Add  the following components to the solution:

* Migrate - Lab 1 - Canvas App
* Migrate - Lab 1 - Flow 1

Turn the flow `on`.

**Export** the solution.

**Import** the solution into another environment, other than `Working`.

Run the app.
